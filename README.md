# UC Berkeley Zero Waste: Waste Truck Route Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing collection routes for large waste and recycling trucks operated under [UC Berkeley Zero Waste](https://sustainability.berkeley.edu/engage/zero-waste). The goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, and enhance service reliability across campus waste-management operations.

By analyzing historical collection data, bin fill levels, travel times, and geographic service zones, this project identifies inefficiencies in current routing practices and develops data-driven, optimized routes that minimize unnecessary travel and missed efficiencies.

This project is completed as part of IND ENG 180: Senior Project at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Objectives

- Reduce total distance traveled by waste collection trucks
- Lower fuel consumption and associated emissions
- Improve reliability and consistency of waste pickup schedules
- Support more sustainable and cost-effective waste-management operations

## Data Sources

### Available Data

- Scanned logs of existing waste collection routes
- Amount of waste collected at each stop

### Data to Be Collected

- GPS coordinates of waste and recycling enclosures across campus

## Methodology

This project combines operations research, data analytics, and geospatial analysis techniques, including:

- Route optimization algorithms (e.g., vehicle routing problem–based approaches)
- Predictive modeling for bin fill patterns
- GIS-based spatial analysis of service zones and travel paths
- Comparative analysis of current versus optimized routing strategies

## Tools & Technologies

- Python for data processing, modeling, and optimization
- GIS tools for spatial visualization and spatial analysis
- Optimization and routing libraries (Gurobi, ...)
- Data visualization libraries for results and performance comparison

## Expected Outcomes

- Optimized waste collection routes that reduce travel distance and time
- Streamlined and more reliable daily collection schedules
- Quantifiable reductions in fuel consumption and emissions
- Actionable insights to support operational decision-making
